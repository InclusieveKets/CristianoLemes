		<h1 id="3d-printer">3D Printer</h1>

<p>The section started with the current situation of the Corona virus and the measurements taken by the Belgian government that everyone should follow.
This section was the first of a series of online meetings to avoid social contact in order to control the spreading of the COVID-19 virus.</p>

<p>The main topic in this section was 3D Printer.
It was presented different materials and types of printers existing in the market.
Warnings about how to print 3D objects was presented including some examples of objects done in the Fablab.</p>

<p>Several softwares were presented about how to design 3D objects that can be sent to a 3D printer.
Highlight for <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com">Tinkercad</a>, <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-curaâ€©last">Ultimaker Cura</a>, and <a href="https://www.onshape.com">Onshape</a>.
Tinkercad was the simplest one having interesting functionalities but limited if you want to design advanced shapes.
On the other hand, Onshape has several complex functionalities but it requires sometime to learn how to use it and take advantage of its strenght.</p>

<p>One important note from this class is that after using the 3D printer is always necessary spend sometime to finish the 3D object.
Sometimes is necessary remove supports, or clean the shape, or even include an away to assembly the distincts parts of the object you want to create.</p>
