-Teacher: Bruce Helsen
- we are mostly work with Arduino.

-Basics about electronics
	physical concepts (units)
		resistences 					-> symbol: R -> unit: Ohm	Symbol: \omega
Grootheid: spanning (voltage) 			-> symbol: U	unit: V
		Stroom (current) 				-> symbol: I	unit: Ampare A
		Vermogen (eletrical power)		-> symbol: P 	unit: 
		Zelfinductie(Induction)			-> symbol: L 	unit: Henry		symbol: H
	resistences of differents materials
	Equations
		U = R x I	(i)		I = U / R
		P = U x I 	(ii)	I = P / U
		P = U^2 / R (iii)

-Tools to support electronics circuit (measurements tools)
	Power supply - generate power to the circuit; fancy power supply; old power supply for computer; phone charger;
	Muiltimeter	- to measure the voltage and current and resistence; we need to connect the wires correct to get the right measurement.
	Oscilloscoop - measure only voltage in real time and show the waves of its variation.
	Functie generator - 

-Basic components
	Weerstanden (Resistor)
		regelbaar (adjustable resistor) - potentiometer
		Variabel: 
		LDR: light dependent resistor.
		Temp gevoelig (temperature resistor)
		Flexible resistors
		Kleurcodes(colors codes for resistors)
	Bron (power supply)
		batteries, or any energy sources.
	Schakelaar (switches)
		used to close or open the electronic circuit.
		Soorten: normal open/close; bistabiel/drukknop; meer polig; wisselschakelaar (SPDT - single pin)
	Spoel (Inductors)
	Condensator (capacitors)
		Used to save (little) energy to perform functionalities when there is not power supply;
	Relais(Relay)
		switch that can be controled using energy;
	Diode
		let the current flow only in one direction;
		diferent kinds of diodes: zenerdiode(stabilsator), schotkeydiode(), photodiode
		LED is a real exampe of diode;
	Transistor
		Amplify the current; current control;
		need a protective resistor.
		equations:	I_c = I_b x H_fe
					I_e = I_c + I_b
		BC547 is most used.
		summary
			H_fe DC current gain
			V_be Base emitter forward voltage
			I_c Collector Currentor
	Mosfet()
		Voltage controller for the current flowing;
		N channe (enhancement, enhancement no bulk semi, depletion)
		summary
			V_ds drain'source breakdown voltage
			V_gs(th) gate threshold voltage
			V_gs(on) static drain-source on-
	Spanningsregelaar
		Voltage regulator; it consumes the excedent voltage used in the component.
	Spanningsdeler
		Voltage dividor;

how to calculate the resistor to not burn a LED
	U_r = U_bronspanning - U_LED / stroom door LED

	U_b = 12V; U_led=1.78V; I_led=10mA
	U_r = 12V - 1.78 = 10.22
	R = U / I = 10.22 / 0.01 = 1022\omega

how to use transistor to switch larger controler
Transistor/Mosfet
	See example for Transistor and calculation done during class.
	See example for Mosfet.

important use a diode to avoid burn the relay;
calculate the resistor in order to turn on the relay;

Motoren(motors):
	DC motoren - normal motor (turn around in circle)
	Servo Motoren - like an arm
	Stappen motoren - control how the motor turn around in circle.

Buzzer
	change shape and create voltage;

Opdracht (task for next week)
	try to design a circuit.
