# Overview

This page meant to include extra material that might inspire to get ideas for the final project of the FabZero course.


## Useful links for the final project

Choose the topic for the final project might be challenge and time consuming.
Find the right project that will enable to apply the knowledge acquired during the course and at the same time be enjoyable can be stressful.
For that, some tips might help us to find the right topic for our final projects.
[El-Pro-cus](https://www.elprocus.com/) provides [an article](https://www.elprocus.com/how-to-choose-electrical-and-electronics-projects-ideas-engineering-students/) about relevants tips for choosing projects ideas for the final project.
The Youtube channel [I-Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiIYevEsvO8rp1n_5QgldZg) has a video with the [top 10 arduino projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI073sITRAs) that might be interessant for inspiring to design your own project.

Another website that brings good information about eletronic project is (Electronic Hub)[https://www.electronicshub.org/].
They provide several articles with a full list of diverse projects including their description and electronic circuit that might solve the problem.
Following the list of articles I have found, however they are only different ways of organizing the projects, which means there are several overlap of projects between these links.
