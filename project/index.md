title: Final project for Fabzero course
---

# Introduction

The idea of the final project for the Fabzero course is to design a robotic arm that is able to recognize an object and take it dropping off in a place to be defined later.
This project differs from the existing ones because integrate the robotic arm with a vehicle and recognize the object that it should take it.
If the time allows, an artificial inteligence can be integrate in the vehicle to turn it autonomous.

This project is split in five main parts.
Some of them has sub tasks to make it easier the design of this project.

* Design the robotic arm.
	* Start with an arm with two points of movement.
	* Include as much point of movement as necessary.
* Design the mobile vehicle.
* Design the image recognition.
* Design a mobile app.
* Integrate all parts together.
