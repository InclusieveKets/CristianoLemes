# Introduction

Steps taken to design of the Robotic Arm.

I have decided to design an robotic arm with the following moviment: circular sholder (simulating the circular movement of the sholder), horizontal sholder, elbow, wrist, and fingers (initially two fingers).
For each movement possible, it will be necessary a servo.
The type of Servo to use is not chosen yet and it requires some research or suggestion.
The fingers, I still do not know the best way to do it, using one servo and gears to move or using two servos and programing the arduino to move correctly the fingers (without the servos trying to move against each other).
The design of the arm itself is not picture yet in my mind, but I have drawn a sketch of the circuit based in this idea.
