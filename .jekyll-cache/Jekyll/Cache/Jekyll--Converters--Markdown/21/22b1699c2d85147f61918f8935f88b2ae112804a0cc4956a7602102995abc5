<p>The idea of the final project for the Fabzero course is to design a robotic arm that is able to recognize an object and take it dropping off in a place to be defined later.
This project differs from the existing ones because integrate the robotic arm with a vehicle and recognize the object that it should take it.
If the time allows, an artificial inteligence can be integrate in the vehicle to turn it autonomous.</p>

<p>This project is split in five main parts.
Some of them has sub tasks to make it easier the design of this project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design the robotic arm.
    <ul>
      <li>Start with an arm with two points of movement.</li>
      <li>Include as much point of movement as necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design the mobile vehicle.</li>
  <li>Design the image recognition.</li>
  <li>Design a mobile app.</li>
  <li>Integrate all parts together.</li>
</ul>
