<p>The class took place again by Zoom and the speecher was Bruce Helsen that talked about KiCAD.
KiCAD is a tool to design electronic boards using different types of material.
It gives an overview of the project, possible problems and a 3D image of the electronic board that will be resulted.
The class covered (i) its history, (ii) important terminologies, (iii) prototype to end product, (iv) PCB (print circuit board) methodology, and (v) PCB design.
It was presented an example of the main functionalities of the tool.</p>

<p>Last week it was introduced another tool that supports the design of electronic circuits.
The falstad.com is used to simulate the circuit and to check the variation of voltage and current for verifying if the circuit will not burn any other component.
It is also used to calculate the voltage and resistence necessary for keeping the circuit alive.
KiCAD take advantage of the circuit designed by this tool and allows to create a project of the resulted PCB for the final circuit.</p>
