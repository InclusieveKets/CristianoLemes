# Basic of electronics

The class took place by Zoom where Bruce Helsen could share his knowledge and experience with everyone.
Basically the class was organazied in the following parts: (i) Basics concepts in electronics circuits; (ii) Measurements tools that supports electronics; (iii) Basics components used to design a circuit; (iv) How to apply the theory in practice to choose the correct component when designing a circuit; and (v) Some examples of Transistor and Mosfet.
Shortly we got the idea of (vi) Motors and (vii) Buzzers.

## Basics concepts

| concept | symbol | unit | symbol |
| Resistence | R | Ohm | $\omega$ |
| Voltage | U | Volts | V |
| Current | I | Ampere | A |
| Eletrical power | P | . | . |
| Induction | L | Henry | H |

It was presented the resistence values for different types or materials.

Important equations was introduced as well.

$$
	U = R * I
$$

$$
	P = U * I
$$

$$
	P = U^2 / R
$$
