# Material and design

The class took place by Zoom and the topic of this section was materials that we can use in our project and how we can design it.
It was presented several ideas of path that we can follow in order to achieve good results in the final project.
One tip about it is that when we need to bring prototypes to a customer, that we should bring at least 3 ideas to facilitate the customer choose one of them and also mix the ideas.
Bringing only one idea puts the customer in a situation that he/she cannot say that they did not like; bringing two is not enough options; three enables the customer to like one of them maybe including features from the other ideas.
About the material that we can use in the lab, it was talked a bit in a previous section and this section complemented this topic.
The material ABS supports the heat from eletronics circuits and it allow to make holes even after finished.
On the other hand, PLA is good for projects that need parts to be connected, like gears.
Remember to avoid mirrors or anything that reflects in a laser cut machine.
