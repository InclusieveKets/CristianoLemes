Bases of Arduino

-open source computer platform
	purpose: facilitate microcontroller applications.
		fisical computing;
-first version 2005
-It can connect several eletronics components and can host also software;
-microcontroller: contains everything the arduino need to works;
	ATmega328 long new version;
-if using USB and Vin (input energy), USB is only for communication;
	Vin and USB cannot be connected to two sources with their own ground pin;
-NanoArduino consumes a lot of energy;
-Lilypad and Flora
-Arduino is open source and open hardware;

Breadboard
-important to read the datasheet of the component using to use the right voltage;


Programming (arduino IDE)
-Sketch: arduino programm;
-select the type of arduino and port;

Digital pins can be used as input data (0 or 1);
	be sure the voltage that the digital pin will generate to use the right value;

Effect trigger a function that we want after a defined time;

-task
	combine servo, LED and button
	important to combine input and output;
